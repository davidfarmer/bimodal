  <title>A toy model</title>

<introduction>
<p>
We have argued that the second bump arises when consecutive zero
gaps are larger than average, with the details about the remaining
zeros playing a lesser role.  We will explore this by analyzing a simple
example.

<title>Excised roots of unity</title>

<p>
Consider <m>x^n-1</m> where two zeros have been deleted, creating
consecutive zero gaps of twice the average.  That is, let
<men>
f_n(x) = \frac{x^n-1}{(1-e^{2\pi i/n}x)(1-e^{-2\pi i/n}x)}
= \frac{x^n-1}{1-2 \cos(2 \pi/n)x + x^2}
</men>.
<xref ref="model1fig"/> illustrates the cases <m>n=20</m> and <m>n=40</m>.

<proposition>
<statement>
<p>The derivative of <m>f_n</m> has a zero within <m>O(1/n^2)</m> of <m>1 - b_0/n</m>,
where <m>b_0 = 2.3565\ldots</m> is the unique real root of
<m>  4 \pi^2 +2 b + b^2 - 2 b e^b</m>. 
</p>
</statement>

<proof>
<p>
By the quotient rule, the zeros of <m>f'_n</m> are the same as the
zeros of
<men>
<!--
f_n(x) = -2 \cos(2 \pi/n)  + 2 x + n x^{-1 + n} + 2 \cos(2 \pi/n)  x^n - 2 \cos(2 \pi/n)  n x^n - 2 x^{1 + n} + 
 n x^{1 + n}.
-->
f_n(x) = -2 \cos(2 \pi/n)  + 2 x + n x^{-1 + n} + 2 \cos(2 \pi/n)(1-n)  x^n - (2-n) x^{1 + n}
</men>
Since <m>f_n(0) \approx -2</m> and <m>f_n(1) \approx 4\pi^2/n</m>, we see that
<m>f_n</m> has a real zero in the interval <m>(0, 1)</m>, and that zero should be
close to <m>1</m>.
</p>

<p>
Setting <m>x = 1-b/n</m> and expanding to order <m>1/n^2</m> we find
<men>
f_n(1 - b/n) =
e^{-b}\, \frac{2 b + b^2 - 2 b e^b + 4 \pi^2}n + 
 e^{-b} \, \frac{-b^4 - 8 \pi^2 - 4 b^2 \pi^2 + 8 e^b \pi^2}{2 n^2}
+O\left(\frac{1}{n^3}\right) 
</men>.
Thus, <m>f_n(1 - b_0/n) = O(1/n^2)</m>. The argument is completed
by Rouch√©'s theorem.
</p>


</proof>

</proposition>
<p>
Suppose the polynomial <m>f_n</m> was modified so that the roots at
<m>E^{\pm 2\pi i \cdot 2/n}</m> instead were at <m>E^{2\pi i \cdot c_\pm /n}</m>,
where <m>1\lt c_+ \lt 3</m> and <m>-3\lt c_- \lt -1</m>.
Using the above method, one can check throught those ranges the derivative of the 
modified polynomial  has a root within <m>0.8/n</m> of <m>1-2.6/n</m>.
This is a much narrower range than asserted in <xref ref="sourceofhump2"/>.
</p>

<subsection>
<title>A final remark</title>

<p>
We have seen that, from the perspective of the geometry of zeros
of polynomials, the behavior of the zeros of the derivative
of a unitary polynomial <m>p</m> is quite complicated.  There are at least
three (partially overlapping)
 regimes for the zeros of<nbsp/><m>p'</m>, and in each regime the nature
of the dominant influence is different.
</p>

<p>
This suggests that making progress on understanding the distribution of
zeros of<nbsp/><m>p'</m>, proving that the distribution is bimodal for example,
may need to come from another approach.  The expected value of moments of <m>\abs{p_u'(1-r/N)}</m>
for <m>u\in U(N)</m>
seems a more likely avenue for progress. 
However, it could still be interesting to quantify the way in which
appropriately spaced triples of zeros contribute to the 2nd mode.
