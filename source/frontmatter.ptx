The derivative of a polynomial with all zeros on the unit circle
has the zeros of its derivative on or inside the unit circle.  It has
been observed that in many cases the zeros of the derivative have a
bimodal distribution: there are two smaller circles near which is it
more likely to find those zeros.  We identify the likely source of
the second mode.  This idea is supported with numerical examples involving
the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices.
