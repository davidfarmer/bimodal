<p>
A <term>unitary polynomial</term> is a polynomial <m>p</m> having
all roots on the
unit circle, <m>\{z \in \CC \ :\ \abs{z} = 1\}</m>.
We denote those zeros by <m>e^{i\theta_1},\ldots,e^{i\theta_N}</m>,
where <m>0\le \theta_1\le \cdots \le \theta_N \lt 2\pi</m>.
By the Gauss-Lucas theorem, all the roots of the derivative
<m>p'</m> lie in the unit disc,  <m>\{z \in \CC \ :\ \abs{z} \le 1\}</m>,
with the only zeros of <m>p'</m> on the unit circle arising from
multiple zeros of<nbsp/><m>p</m>.
</p>

<p>
We consider the case of unitary polynomials with zeros
<m>z_1,\ldots,z_n</m> randomly, but not necessarily independently,
distributed on the unit circle.
The zeros of the derivative <m>z'_1,\ldots,z'_{n-1}</m> will be random
points in the unit disc: we want to understand their distribution.
We will further assume that the distribution of zeros is rotationally
invariant: the likelihood of zeros
<m>\{e^{i\theta_1},\ldots,e^{i\theta_n}\}</m> is the same as the likelihood of
<m>\{e^{i\theta_1+\phi},\ldots,e^{i\theta_n+\phi}\}</m> for any <m>\phi\in\RR</m>.
In this case it is natural to look at the radial distribution of
the zeros of the derivative, that is, the distribution of<nbsp/><m>\abs{z'_j}</m>.
</p>

<p>
It is also helpful to imagine that any finite sequence of normalized neighbor
spacings can occur.  See <xref ref="sec_stable"/>.
</p>

<p>
The zeros of <m>p'</m> will cluster near the
unit circle, equivalently, most of the <m>\abs{z'}</m> will be very close
to<nbsp/><m>1</m>.
As described in <xref ref="mez, dffhmp"/>,
for degree <m>N</m> polynomials the appropriate rescaling is to consider
<m>N (1 - \abs{z'})</m>.  It was found <xref ref="dffhmp"/> that in a wide variety of
cases the distribution of <m>\abs{z'}</m> is bimodal: the probability density
function (PDF) has two local maxima.
</p>

<p>
We perform various experiments which indicate the source of the
second mode.   We focus on the case of characteristic polynomials of
random unitary matrices.  That is, <m>u\in U(N)</m> is selected randomly
with respect to Haar measure, and <m>p_u</m> is its characteristic polynomial.
<!--
In this case the second local maximum in the PDF for <m>\abs{z'}</m>,
for <m>z'</m>
 zero of <m>p'</m>,
lies near <m>1-2.6/N</m>.

<title>The three regimes</title>

<p>
We suggest that a productive way to think about the zeros of <m>p'</m>
is to recognize three regions.  One is the annulus between the unit circle
and (approximately) the circle of radius <m>1-2/N</m>.  In that region, most of the zeros
of <m>p'</m> arise from closely spaced zeros of<nbsp/><m>p</m>.
This situation was analyzed in detail in<nbsp/><xref ref="dffhmp"/>.
But note that zeros of <m>p'</m> very close to the unit circle also arise from sufficiently long strings
of consecutive zeros of <m>p</m> spaced closer than average: see<nbsp/><xref ref="farmer_ki"/>.
</p>

<p>
The second is the annulus between (approximately) the circles of radius <m>1-2/N</m> and
of radius <m>1-4/N</m>.  Here some of the zeros of <m>p'</m>
arise from zeros spaced slightly closer than average, or from clusters
of such zeros.  But in that region many of the zeros of <m>p'</m> arise from
a different source:
triples of consecutive zeros, where both neighbor gaps are larger than average.
See <xref ref="thesource"/> for a discussion.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, in both of those regions typically the location of the zeros of <m>p'</m>
is primarily determined by a few nearby zeros of<nbsp/><m>p</m>.
That is, if there is a zero <m>z'</m> of <m>p'_0</m>
in that region,
and <m>p_1</m> is another polynomial of the same degree, with <m>p_0</m>
and <m>p_1</m> having the same zeros near  <m>z'</m>, then
<m>p'_1</m> will typically have a zero
close to <m>z'</m>.  In other words,
zeros of <m>p'</m> which are closer than (approximately)
<m>4/N</m> of the unit circle, depend primarily on the local arrangement
of zeros of<nbsp/><m>p</m>.
</p>

<p>
In contrast, the zeros of <m>p'</m> farther than (approximately)
<m>4/N</m> from the unit circle are sensitive to the bulk of the
zeros of <m>p</m>.  
See <xref ref="jiggled"/> for an illustration of this phenomenon.
<xref ref="combinedpdf"/> indicates that
approximately<nbsp/><m>25\%</m> of the zeros of <m>p'</m> fall
into that category.
</p>

<p>
In the examples where we plot zeros of <m>p'</m> in the unit circle,
we also show (as dotted lines) the circles of radius <m>1-2/N</m>
and <m>1-4/N</m>.
</p>

</paragraphs>

<p>
The existence of multiple regions with different behaviors
suggests that determining the distribution of zeros of <m>p'</m>
is truly a difficult problem.
