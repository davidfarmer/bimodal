  <title>Random characteristic polynomials</title>

<introduction>
<p>
Motivated by the connection to the Riemann <m>\zeta</m>-function and other L-functions,
and building on previous work<nbsp/><xref ref="mez dffhmp"/>, our examples will primarily
come from the characteristic polynomials of random unitary matrices,
where the randomness is uniform with respect to Haar measure on the
unitary group<nbsp/><m>U(n)</m>. 
</p>
</introduction>

<subsection>
<title>Some experiments to gain intuition</title>

<p>
Generating Haar-random unitary matrices is easy in principle, but there are
two likely pitfalls.  The first, explained in<nbsp/><xref ref="Mez_haar"/>,
is that the built-in <m>QR</m>-decomposition routine in many computer-algebra
systems introduces a bias.  The second is that the built-in routine to find the
eigenvalues of a matrix may give incorrect results if the matrix is large
and the entries are not known with sufficient precision.
This Mathematica code addresses both issues, although it is left to the
user to ensure that sufficient precision is selected.

<p>
Our first experiment is to compile data on the radial distribution of zeros
of derivatives.

<example>
<title>Producing a large data set</title>
<statement>
<p>
Start with an empty list named <c>zp20</c>.
Generate <m>5.4 \times 10^{6}</m> Haar-random matrices in <m>U(20)</m>.  For each matrix:
<ol>
<li>
form the characteristic polynomial
</li>
<li>
take its derivative
</li>
<li>
compute approximations to the zeros of the derivative
</li>
<li>
append the absolute values of those zeros to the list <c>zp20</c>.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
The list <c>zp20</c> will contain approximately <m>10^{8}</m>
real numbers <m>\{r_j\}</m> with <m>0 \lt r_j \lt 1</m>.
Note that those inequalities are strict, because the probability
of hitting either extreme is<nbsp/><m>0</m>.
<xref ref="zp20pdf1"/> shows a histogram, normalized to have area<nbsp/><m>1</m>,
of <m>20 (1 - r_j)</m>.

Is the second bump a transient phenomenon, or will it persist in the large <m>N</m> limit?

           the final two graphs being nearly imperceptible.</description>

    </figure>


<p>
Does <xref ref="combinedpdf"/> support a claim that the second bump persists as<nbsp/><m>N\to\infty</m>?
</p>

<p>
One possible argument against such interpretation is that some features,
for example the value distribution of<nbsp/><m>p_u(1)</m> for random <m>u\in U(N)</m>, approach their limiting behavior
on the scale of <m>1/\sqrt{\log N}</m>.  For such features, most numerical experiments will show
significant deviations from the limiting behavior.
</p>

<p>
We suggest that for the normalized distribution <m>N(1-\abs{z'})</m>, 
the limiting distribution is approached on the scale of <m>1/N^2</m>, and so
<xref ref="combinedpdf"/> does provide persuasive evidence for a second bump
in the limit.  There are three ingredients to our reasoning.
</p>

<p>
First is that the zeros of <m>p'</m> near the two peaks typically depend strongly only on the
relative spacing of a few nearby zeros.  See <xref ref="sec_local"/>.
</p>

<p>
Second is the the relative likelihood of a given cluster of zero spacings stabilizes
quickly as <m>N</m> increases, at the rate of <m>1/N^2</m>.  See <xref ref="sec_stable"/>.
</p>

<p>
Third is that the effect of the curvature of the circle on the rescaled
zeros also decreases as <m>1/N^2</m>.  See <xref ref="sec_curve"/>.

<title>The sensitivity to distant zeros</title>
<statement>
<p>
Start with an empty list named <c>zp40perturbed</c>.
Generate a unitary polynomial <m>p_u</m> for some fixed <m>u\in U(40)</m>.
Perform the following steps  <m>250</m> times:
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Generate a polynomial <m>\tilde{p}</m>, where the
zeros of <m>\tilde{p}</m> are partitioned into two sets:
<ol>
<li>The zeros of <m>p_u</m> in the first quadrant</li>
<li>The other zeros of <m>p_u</m>, with arguments perturbed independently by a random amount
in the interval <m>(-2\pi/40,2\pi/40)</m>.  That is, perturbed by a random amount
less than the average gap between zeros.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</li>
<li>
Compute approximations to the zeros of <m>\tilde{p}'</m>
</li>
<li>
Append those zeros to the list <c>zp40perturbed</c>.
</li>
</ol>
</p>
</statement>

<solution>
<p>
The list <c>zp40perturbed</c> will contain <m>9750</m> points, which are shown
as small blue dots in <xref ref="jiggled"/>.  The roots of <m>p_u</m> are shown as
larger red squares.
</p>

            </caption>
      <image source="jiggledzeros2.png" width="75%">
        <description>The unit circle with 40 small randomly placed red squares.
           Inside the circle are thousands of small blue dots.  In the first
quadrant close to the circle the dots generally are in small isolated clusters.
In the other quadrants there are many blue dots clustered near the circle
and a thinner scattering further from the circle.</description>
      </image>
    </figure>

</solution>
</example>


<p>
In <xref ref="jiggled"/> it can be seen that the zeros of the derivative which
are in the middle of the first quadrant and closer than around <m>4/N</m> from the unit circle,
depend minimally on the other zeros.  
Thus, only the arrangement of small numbers of consecutive zeros determines the
main features of the zeros of the derivative in that region.

<p>
The second ingredient is a property of Haar measure on <m>U(N)</m>. 
Suppose <m>\delta_1 \lt \cdots \lt \delta_k</m>.  We interpret those numbers as
the consecutive normalized gaps between random eigenvalues.
That is, we consider the likelihood that for some <m>\theta_0</m> we have
<m>\{e^{i\theta_0}, e^{i(\theta_0 + 2\pi \delta_1/N)},\ldots, e^{i(\theta_0+2\pi \delta_k/N)}\}</m> as
consecutive eigenvalues of a Haar random matrix in<nbsp/><m>U(N)</m>.  
By <term>likelihood</term> we mean
<men>
\lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \epsilon^{-k} \operatorname{Prob}(\delta_1 \lt \tilde\lambda_1-\tilde\lambda_0 \lt \delta_1 + \epsilon
       \ \land \ \cdots \ \land \ \delta_k \lt \tilde\lambda_k-\tilde\lambda_{k-1} \lt \delta_k + \epsilon)
</men>,
where <m> e^{i \lambda_0},e^{i\lambda_1},\ldots,e^{i\lambda_k}</m> are consecutive eigenvalues of
a random matrix in<nbsp/><m>U(N)</m> and <m>\tilde\lambda = N\lambda/2\pi</m> are the
normalized eigenangles.
In other words, the value of the PDF of the normalized <m>k</m>-neighbor gaps.
By inspection of Haar measure in terms of eigenvalues, the likelihood of a configuration
is nonzero if <m>N</m> is sufficiently large, and as
<m>N\to\infty</m> that likelihood converges to a nonzero limit.
Furthermore, that likelihood can be written in terms of the <m>m</m>-correlation
functions, with <m>m \le k</m>, and each <m>m</m>-correlation converges to
its limit at the rate of <m>1/N^2</m>.  Therefore the likelihood also
converges at that rate.</p>

<p>
Thus, if a property of a unitary polynomial depends only on the local
configuration of zeros, then the limiting behavior of that property can be reliably studied by
performing numerical experiments on random matrices from <m>U(N)</m>
for moderately sized<nbsp/><m>N</m>.
Properties which rely on large numbers of zeros, such as moments or value distribution,
can show significant departures from the limiting behavior.

<title>Curvature effects</title>

<p>
As <m>N\to\infty</m> a given configuration sits on a segment of the circle of length
<m>O(1/N)</m>.  That segment is approaching a straight line, and the discrepancy
is<nbsp/><m>O(1/N^2)</m>.  So that effect is comparable to the previously discussed effects.
</p>
<!--
<p>
As <m>N\to\infty</m> a local configuration of zeros on the unit circle is approaching a
straight line at the rate of <m>1/N^2</m>.  [[[[]]]]
</p>

<p>
The remaining issue is that (on the scale of
the local zero spacing) the curvature of the circle is changing.
That curvature displaces the zeros from being in a straight line on the
scale of <m>1/N</m>, so that is the third ingredient in our argument that
the distribution of <m>N(1-\abs{z'})</m> differs from the limiting distribution
on the scale of<nbsp/><m>1/N</m>.
