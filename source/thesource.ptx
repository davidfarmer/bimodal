  <title>The source of the second bump</title>
  <p>In this section we justify the following:</p>

<claim xml:id="sourceofhump2">
<statement>
<p>
The zeros of <m>p'</m> in the second bump, 
which do not come from two closely spaced zeros, primarily arise
from three consecutive zeros where both zero gaps are
larger than average.  The associated zero of the derivative
is near the radial line from the center of the circle to the middle
zero.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, if <m>e^{i \theta_1}, e^{i \theta_2}, e^{i \theta_3}</m> are consecutive zeros
of<nbsp/><m>p</m>, with
<m>\theta_2 - \theta_1, \theta_3 - \theta_2 > 2\pi/N</m>, 
then <m>p'</m> tends to have a zero within <m>2.5/N</m>
of<nbsp/><m>(1-3/N) z_2</m>.
</p>
</statement>
</claim>

<p>
That claim reinforces the idea that the distribution of
zeros of <m>p'</m> is difficult to analyze.  Given three
zeros of <m>p</m>, we have located one zero of <m>p'</m>.
That leaves at least one, and typically two, zeros unaccounted for.
(But when two consecutive gaps are larger than average, it is more
likely that the gaps on either side are smaller than average,
so that says something about the location of the <q>missing</q>
zeros.  <xref ref="specialcircles"/> contains some examples.)
</p>

<p>
<xref ref="specialcircles"/> illustrates <xref ref="sourceofhump2"/>
using an example with <m>N=30</m>.

<p>
We reinforce <xref ref="sourceofhump2"/> with the following:
</p>
<problem xml:id="exp_special20">
<statement>
<p>
Start with an empty list <c>specialzeros20</c>.
Generate approximately <m>100,000</m> characteristic polynomials
<m>p_u</m> for Haar random <m>u\in U(20)</m>.  In all cases where three
consecutive zeros <m>z_1, z_2, z_3</m> have both gaps larger than average,
select all zeros of the derivative in the target disc of radius <m>2.5/N</m> centered at <m>(1-3/N) z_2</m>.
(That is, select the <m>z'</m> in the small circles, as in <xref ref="specialcircles"/>.)
Append those zeros to <c>specialzeros20</c>.
</p>
</statement>
</problem>

<p>
In <xref ref="exp_special20"/>, the condition on consecutive zeros occurred
around <m>332,000</m> times, which is consistent with the expected
frequency of consecutive gaps which are larger than average.
In those cases, in the target disc, <m>99.43</m>% of the time there was exactly one zero.
Of the remaining <m>0.57</m>%, <m>92.7</m>% of the time there were two zeros,
and in the remaining <m>0.04</m>%, no zeros.
</p>

<p>
<xref ref="pointsinspecialcircles"/> shows all the zeros from <xref ref="exp_special20"/>
in the target discs, as individual points and as a density plot.
That figure gives a clear picture that the configuration of
consecutive larger-than-average gaps contributes
significantly to the second maximum.

Considering the arrangement of the points in <xref ref="pointsinspecialcircles"/>,
one should not expect that density function to have a simple form.
Note that the heavier tail to the right in the histogram corresponds to the
left portion of the cloud of dots.
